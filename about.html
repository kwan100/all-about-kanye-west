            ABOUT KANYE WEST
        </div>
        <div class="about-info">
            Kanye Omari West (/ˈkɑːnjeɪ/; born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, record producer, fashion designer,
            and politician. He has been influential in the 21st-century development of mainstream hip hop and popular 
            music in general.

        <div class="about-info">
            Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West gained notoriety as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the 
            early 2000s, producing singles for several mainstream artists. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper,
            West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to critical and commercial success, and founded 
            the record label GOOD Music. He experimented with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed studio
            albums, including Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008). Drawing inspiration
            from maximalism and minimalism, respectively, West's fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) and
            sixth album Yeezus (2013) were also critical successes. He went on to release The Life of Pablo (2016), Ye (2018),
            and Jesus Is King (2019). West's discography also includes the full-length collaborations Watch the Throne (2011)
            and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Jay-Z and Kid Cudi, respectively.

        <div class="about-info">
            West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant media attention. He has been a frequent
            source of controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings, as well as for
            his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, and race. In 2020, he ran an unsuccessful independent
            presidential campaign that advocated for a consistent life ethic. His Christian faith, as well as his marriage
            to television personality Kim Kardashian, have also been a source of media attention. As a fashion designer, he has 
            collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted 
            in the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA.

            worldwide. He has won a total of 22 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all time. Among his
            other awards are the Billboard Artist Achievement Award, a joint-record three Brit Awards for Best International Male 
            Solo Artist and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. Six of his albums were included on Rolling Stone's 2020 500
            Greatest Albums of All Time list; the same publication named him one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. West
            is the tied holder for the most albums (four) topping the annual Pazz & Jop critic poll. Time magazine named him one
